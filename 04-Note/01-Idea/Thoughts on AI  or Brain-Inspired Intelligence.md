So in this note I wanna to write down some gossip thoughts towards AI, specifically after I listened to Andrew NG's speech towards the future opportunities of AI. 
So, what this speech impresses me is that currently the AI wave, braught by OpenAI ChatGPT, is the development tool. Therefore, there will more application tools developed on AI as the efficiency of coding is hugely promoted. However, the era that AI can do what humans can do is still decades ahead. In other words, what AI can do currently is shortly limited in one area. The generalization of AI model is still weak, perhaps because of the overfitting. 
Actually, this speech reminds me of a debate on Bilibili, what is the insights behind the boom of GPU? For me, the idea is pretty simple. The ChatGPT promoted the development tool, which leads to those companies to follow this mode to train large model on different fields. But this does prove that AI is generative in every field.  There is still the limitation that prevents AI to turn into a grand application in every field. 
So another question that puzzels me is that will AI or brain-inspired intelligence reach the standard of the ture intelligence in the future? The answer is blowing in the wind.
