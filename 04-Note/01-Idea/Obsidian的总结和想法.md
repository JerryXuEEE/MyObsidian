# Zotero-Obsidian 的一些问题
 1. **Link issues.** Zotero像是文献管理和listing categorization tool. Obsidian is more like a note tool. But from Zotero, I cannot locate the exact note in the obsidian related to the article. And after I wrote a note, there is no way to link back to the article. Or is there a way that remains undiscovered.
 2. **Note for the book categorization**  When I write a book note, it is very complicated to write one for a PDF with no DOI. 

I think there is more problem that needs to be solved? TO be continued...
